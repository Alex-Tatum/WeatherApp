Weather App: 

The purpose of this project is to create a weather dashboard that allows you to search a city and get its current weather and the forecast for the next 5 days using an API. 

My Experience: 
I struggled to get the API working for awhile but after lots and lots of research I did finally get the weather to show appropriately and where I wanted it to. And the other big issue for me was getting the cities the user searched for to stay and appear on the side of the dashboard. This assignment really pushed me but I am proud of how it turned out.
